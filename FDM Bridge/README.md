Designed an FDM-printed bridge to span 450mm gap and support 10 kgs.
Bridge made of multiple pieces, max dimension of 230mm, that held together without any adhesive.
Used nTopology to conduct Finite Element Analysis and static analysis on CAD prototypes.
Experimented with lattices and topology optimization to reduce weight of parts and improve aesthetics.
Calibrated print parameters to improve layer adhesion.
