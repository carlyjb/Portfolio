In August 2019 I put together a team for the [Growing Beyond Earth Maker](https://www.instructables.com/contest/beyondEarth/) Challenge, Professional Track. We had ~6 months to create a proposal to redesign the VEGGIE system on the ISS to use space more efficiently to maximize its food production. 

Our design proposals are documented on [Instructables](https://www.instructables.com/member/Draper+AstroGarden+Team/). We submitted two designs which we named Towers & Checkerboard. Towers was selected as a finalist design.
- [Towers](https://www.instructables.com/Towers-AstroGarden/)
- [Checkerboard](https://www.instructables.com/Checkerboard-AstroGarden/)
