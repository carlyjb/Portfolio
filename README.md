Hi, I'm Carly!

I'm a multidisciplinary engineer currently working as a safety-critical and mission-critical software engineer. You can find my [LinkedIn profile here](https://www.linkedin.com/in/carlybuchanan/).

This page is a portfolio of some of my other project work including:
- My [sensitive robotics work](Tactile%20Robotics/README.md) including compliant haptic sensor development and my force-sensitive calligraphy robot with compliant series elastic actuators from my time as an undergraduate at WPI.
- Some of my work from my Additive Manufacturing course from my current Master's program at Boston University including an [FDM-printed bridge](FDM%20Bridge/README.md) and an [SLA-printed miniature pinball machine](SLA%20Pinball/README.md)
- A ongoing personal project to create a [Mimikyu Animatronic](Mimikyu%20Animatronic/README.md)
- And the [Astrogarden (Space Plants)](Space%20Plants/README.md) project I led at Draper
