This page is a portfolio of some of my other project work including:
- My [sensitive robotics work](Tactile%20Robotics/README.md) including compliant haptic sensor development and my force-sensitive calligraphy robot with compliant series elastic actuators from my time as an undergraduate at WPI.
- Some of my work from my Additive Manufacturing course from my current Master's program at Boston University including an [FDM-printed bridge](FDM%20Bridge/README.md) and a fully-actuated [SLA-printed miniature pinball machine](SLA%20Pinball/README.md)
- A ongoing personal project to create a [Mimikyu Animatronic](Mimikyu%20Animatronic/README.md)
- The [Astrogarden (Space Plants)](Space%20Plants/README.md) project I led at Draper as part of a NASA contest to redesign the VEGGIE system on the International Space System to maximize food production.
- The [foldable bicycle rack extension](Compact%20Bike%20Rack/README.md) that I, as part of a team, helped to design and bring through production testing and validation.
- The [Toddler Camera]() I designed, built, and programmed, including 2 custom PCB designs.


When I'm not in grad school, I also enjoy volunteering at [Hatch Makerspace]() and mentoring the [Ligerbots FIRST Robotics Competition Team]().
