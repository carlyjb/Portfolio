#SLA Print Challenge

We were challenged to design an SLA (resin) 3D print that would fit in a 37mm x 37mm x 75mm volume and make use of two walls and the floor of that volume.

I designed a miniature pinball machine which could be printed as a single print, with supports holding all the pieces within the volume. After curing, the supports could then be broken and brought together with snap-together assembly.

The pinball machine featured space-themed decorations, articulated paddles and launcher, and LED lighting.
